# Next.js Learning Repository 📘

Welcome to my **Next.js Learning Repository**! This repository contains my journey and experiments while learning **Next.js**, a powerful React-based framework for building modern web applications.

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the basics of Next.js and its features.
- Build sample applications to reinforce key concepts.
- Experiment with advanced topics like API routes, dynamic routing, and server-side rendering (SSR).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: The primary framework for this project.
- **React**: Core library for building UI components.
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime for API routes.
- **CSS Modules**: For styling components.

## 🚀 Features of This Repository

1. **Basics of Next.js**:
   - Creating pages with the `pages/` directory.
   - Using the `Link` component for navigation.
   - Understanding the static generation (`getStaticProps`) and server-side rendering (`getServerSideProps`).

2. **Routing**:
   - Dynamic routes.
   - Nested routes.
   - API routes for handling backend logic.

3. **Styling**:
   - Using CSS Modules for scoped styles.
   - Exploring global styles and built-in support for CSS preprocessors (e.g., SASS).

4. **Advanced Topics**:
   - Middleware usage.
   - Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).
   - Integrating external APIs.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploying the app on **Vercel**, the platform optimized for Next.js.
